# Retrospective for February 28, 2022

Covers from August 20, 2021 to February 28, 2022 very loosely from memory. Further retros should cover the gap between the last as 4 to 6 week sprints, possibly longer. As I do more of these, I may choose to follow a normal 2 week cadence and give this the Scrum treatment. Now I'm wondering if this could all be in Jira with a unique workflow ::ponder:: (I'll figure out Markdown emoji's later).
