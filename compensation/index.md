# (Total) Compensation

The intent of this section is to highlight the total compensation for the places I've calculated. I have a rough document of a few highlights but I can't get too in depth
with a few employers, primarily because I doubt I have the documentation but more importantly I don't care too much about very specifics.

Starting now, however, the plan is to calculate as much as possible from Rethink forward. Whenever an opportunity gets to the offer stage, I should draw up a basic doc
to get an understanding of where I'm coming from and going to. I should always be improving in all things.
