From the MIT Career Development Handbook, "You have 60 seconds to convince an employer to engage you further."
While that book frames the pitch from a college graduate perspective, this should be altered to pitch what I'm looking for in job opportunities.
This may change over time or may include information to help craft pitches where the actual pitch lives in another file. I'm not quite sure
what the end result will be yet.

The handbook also mentions "developing a meaningful elevator pitch requires research on the person, company, organization, or program that you are making a connection with." This means that each pitch should at least be slightly tailored to the company though we can go quite a long way in making a generic template.

## Thank You Notes

I usually include a bit of the following:

* A thank you to the recruiter and the person I spoke with
* Some follow up about what you spoke about (Additional comments, questions, etc)
* I also include some comments about the problem we solved if it was a tech interview. I would also suggest sending a better solution if you have the time to type one out. Or solve it if time ran out.
