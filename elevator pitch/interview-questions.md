# Interview Questions

The set of questions asked during a typical interview. A mashup of preemptive questions like "Why the transition to Elixir?" and material mined directly from interview notes. Ideally this would be answers to all questions in one place but as I interview more frequently it'll likely be curated to save navigation time during interviews.
