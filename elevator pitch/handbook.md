# MIT Career Development Handbook

You have 60 seconds to convince an employer to engage you further

## Goals

* Identify the goal of the pitch
    * Self-introduction
    * Advertisement
    * Building a connection
* Clearly describe what you do
    * What you study, research, build, make
    * Past experiences
* Focus on strengths
    * Unique ideas, recent activities, latest accomplishments
* Credit and/or compliment
    * Team members, supervisors, mentors
* Engage listener with a question
    * Offer an opportunity to respond

## Avoid Missed Opportunities

Often times, we miss opportunities because of our lack of intent, preparation, or comfort in commonplace conversations. We can also miss an opportunity to effectively communicate by minimizing or overinflating discussions of responsibilities and accomplishments.

## Do Your Research

Developing a meaningful elevator pitch requires research on the person, company, organization, or program that you are making a connection with. You should pinpoint qualifications, skills, and experiences that best align with the opportunity and reiterate interest in learning more.

## Body Language

Be mindful of body language and use hand motions moderately. Maintaining enthusiasm and energy is significant. If you jitter in nervousness, consider grounding your feet to the floor and lean in when appropriate. And most importantly, don’t underestimate the power of a smile.

## Managing Anxiety and Self-Doubt

Engaging in persuasive speech and talking about yourself can be a daunting experience that stirs up anxiety and self-doubt. Manage your angst with breathing techniques, power poses, inspirational quotes, positive attitude, and humor.

## Practice, Practice, Practice

Assess the content you might add to your elevator pitch, acknowledge your successes with confidence, examine your body language, and identify growth areas to continue strengthening your pitch. You can practice your elevator pitch on your own, with a friend or mentor, or with a counselor at CAPD. Even while you practice, don’t forget to dress the part, sometimes a blazer goes a long way. Be sure to focus on the message and being true to yourself—authenticity is impressive!

## Examples

“Hi, my name is Zoey Ali and I am a junior studying Material Science and Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. Last summer I interned at 3M working on a project with a team assessing the heat resistance of a new plastics product. I was able to use my skills in software engineering to analyze past product failures and predict upcoming product failures. While I am knowledgeable in statistical applications, I also have a strong background and interest in metals, energy, and manufacturing. It’s definitely been reassuring to see Boeing’s commitment to those areas in the last few years. What are the most collaborative projects that interns typically work on at Boeing?”

“Hi, my name is Jin Xia and I am a sophomore majoring in Biological Engineering. I am currently working in the laboratory of Dr. Lin, where our research is focused on correcting mutations that cause organ diseases. While my research is in the early stage, I have successfully demonstrated that the CRISPR technology method works in my hands. I plan to combine this experience working with DNA sequences with the knowledge that I have gained in my computer science courses, to contribute to the field of computational biology. I understand that your company has a significant program in this area. Can you please tell me more about the ongoing projects in computational biology and the opportunities you have?”
