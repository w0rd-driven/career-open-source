## Summary

This code base started in 2016 as just my jsonresume and relevant files. In February 24, 2020 that converged into this existing format.
This heavily leverages Obsidian to greatly enhance workflows. Obsidian's template functionality allows us to open a standup journal every time it's opened.
It's recommended to close and open once per day to utilize this behavior. I find it's not too difficult to estimate 8 hours of daily tasks if done this way.

After estimating my day, I then finalize the prior day's notes. This allows me to prune everything back to only focus on what I accomplished.
I tend to also complete the `Diary` portion that is meant to highlight skills used or learned. This is a great place for a TIL.
Finalizing tasks tends to take the most time so someone with more discipline may prefer to do more during the day as tasks complete.

The `Directory Structure` section gives a brief explanation of each directory and how things are split up.
The `TODO` section lists my plan to refine the processes further.

## Directory Structure

* [action plan](action%20plan/index.md)
    * Action plan for job opportunities that's a little out of place but there is a ton of ancillary information.
