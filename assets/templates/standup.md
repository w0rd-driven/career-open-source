## Instructions

* Choose your goals by checking off what **should get done today**.
    * The chosen tasks should be an estimate covering 4-8 hours a day. This is an exercise in estimation strategies and time boxing.
    * Choose one from each category or multiples from a single category. At least one thing should be accomplished every day.
    * One task from each category should be completed per week.
    * Job opportunity work should drop off sharply with a new job but I need to keep these skills sharp throughout my entire career.
        * Interview every few months.
* Prune tasks
    * That we know we won't complete or care to address. These are ideas, not mandates.
    * At the end of the day, remove **everything not touched**.
        * This allows us to pick up something we didn't set as a goal when we have time.
* If you think of something new, add it to the template in `assets/templates/standup.md`. This file will be larger than expected but we don't want to come up with something to work on very often.

## Agenda

1. Blockers
2. What did you do yesterday?
