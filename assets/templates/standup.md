## Instructions

* Choose your goals by checking off what **should get done today**.
    * Choose one from each category or multiples from a single category. At least one thing should be accomplished every day.
    * One task from each category should be completed per week.
    * Job opportunity work should drop off sharply with a new job but I need to keep these skills sharp throughout my entire career so interview every few months.
* At the end of the day, remove **everything not touched**.
    * This allows us to pick up something we didn't set as a goal when we have time.
* If you think of something new, add it to the template in `assets/templates/standup.md`. This file will be larger than expected due to this but we don't want to have to come up with something to work on.

## Agenda

1. Blockers
2. What did you do yesterday?
    1. The previous day's note should mark completed vs intended vs attempted goals
3. What are your goals for today?
    1. [See below](#tasks)
4. How close are we to hitting our sprint goals? Whatâ€™s your comfort level?
