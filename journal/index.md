# Career Journal

This is the location for daily standup files or any journaling done through tools like Obsidian. It's good to have a centralized dev journal and this intends to be such a place. I previously converted notes I kept for Laravel or Elixir/Phoenix at https://braytonium.com/journal/. While this deviates
quite a bit, that weekly format was somewhat sufficient too. That file was a long running document where I would mark the day I learned something and convert it into a weekly grouping for the blog.
