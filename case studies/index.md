# Case Studies

This is a section to help uncover resume talking points by diving deep into analytics about various projects like monthly recurring revenue (MRR) or understanding impact. This differs from [Stories](../stories/index) as there is way more code examples or statistics that would be difficult to cover in an interview setting. There may or may not be overlap as not everything I would discuss in an interview would have this kind of detail.
