# Rejected

The application or research lead to a rejection. I generally try to find major red flags that indicate I don't want to work for the company before the research notes are generated but I sometimes miss them.
The next stage is one of the following:

* Research
    * If applied before or the post expired, it is typically useful to go through at least a portion of the research phase again. The company may not have changed much but the expectations for the post might.
* Applied
    * Application (to be) sent. This typically happens if the research was complete and the post was identical.
