# Ghosted

One or both parties ghosted the other. I have stopped responding before, not out of intentional malice but my attention issues makes it difficult to respond in a timely manner when I'm overloaded. To put it another way, ghosting is sometimes a 2-way street.
The next stage is one of the following:

* Research
    * Research resumes. Files should ideally be generated again to preserve history but we could possibly do that with the same information depending on where in the process the breakdown occurred.
* Applied
    * Application (to be) sent. This typically happens if the research was complete and the breakdown happened early. Files may or may not be reused.
