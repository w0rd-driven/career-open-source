## Questions

* Senior seems different than technical lead yet it's mentioned in the job post.
* This seems like mostly a backend role. Are there opportunities for more full stack development or is it solely backend?

## Highlights

* Financial software
* Risk and Finance Engineering team (Platform Engineering not Product Engineering)

## Cover letter

* Refactored purchasing from storing encrypted cards in the database to leveraging Authorize.net to vault cards and purchases.
* Purchasing saw very few hiccups, mainly around Authorize.net SDK breakage and scrambling to find problems in less than 4 hours.
* Set the technical vision for numerous internal projects at Rethink.
