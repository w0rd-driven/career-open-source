# Research Checklist

This checklist should be an action-only version of the [current action plan](/action%20plan/opportunities--2021/index.md) as it related to research notes. Refer to that for a deeper explanation of each section.

## Preliminary Research

Time to complete: ~25 minutes (Pomodoro)

Quickly produce a pass or fail. Fail halts the process while a pass moves to the application research phase that'll produce our finished application and unique cover letter.

* [ ] Gather source urls.
    * [ ] Job description page
    * [ ] Careers page
    * [ ] Main website, feature pages, about the team

    * This is primarily discretion based. Salary will almost always end a conversation but bad reviews on Glassdoor for instance may be a temporary problem.
    * [ ] Low salary - I have a lower range that must be met to support my family.
        * [ ] Check job boards for inclusion.
        * [ ] Check Glassdoor for estimates.
    * [ ] Drug test - I don't want to feel like a criminal when take CBD to curb rare anxiety spikes. I've stressed about these in the past and I'd rather not be subject to that ever again. The interview process is stressful enough.
    * [ ] Crypto / NFTs - I don't want to get paid from potentially volatile sources.
    * [ ] Significant recent bad Glassdoor reviews - Signals potential problems with leadership.
* [ ] Vibe check complete.
    * [ ] Record `Vibe: Pass` in source document.

* [ ] Fail
    * [ ] Note in the action plan rejected document with reason of rejection.
    * [ ] Wrap up processing.
* [ ] Pass
    * Record timestamp as `Preliminary research completed: ` in source document.
    * Move on to the next section.

TODO: Move this section as this file should only be generated after a `Pass` vibe is reached. This applies to every prospect.

## Application Research

Time to complete: ~25 minutes (Pomodoro)

Time spent leading up to completing application should be a total of 1-1.5 hours. If my hourly rate is x, I don't want to spend x times 2 or 3 to get to this point.

### Preliminary Setup

* [ ] Generate prospect template files.
* [ ] Move sections from source file to the [prospect research notes](index.md).
    * [ ] Status
        * [ ] `Vibe: Pass`
        * [ ] `Rating: {number}`
    * [ ] Flags
    * [ ] Sources urls
* [ ] Gather more source urls.
    * [ ] About the team
    * Understanding the stack
        * [ ] Engineering blog
        * [ ] StackShare
    * [ ] Employee handbook

### Required

The following sections are required to finalize our research.

#### Job Description Checklist
 
* [ ] Capture `Job Description Checklist` as markdown.
    * [ ] Automated via Livebook notebook.
    * [ ] Manually copy/paste, adding `[ ]` for every list item.
    * [ ] Check off line items I match with. It's also useful to highlight what I would be capable of covering. I may not know Go well but I could be persuaded to ramp up after Elixir solidifies.

#### Application Fields

* [ ] Capture `Application Fields` as markdown.
    * **Not necessary for completion but highly encouraged for historical purposes.**
    * [ ] Automated via Livebook notebook.
    * [ ] Manually copy/paste.
    * [ ] Fill in responses.

#### Cover Letter

* [ ] Capture `Cover Letter` highlights.
    * [ ] Mine the job description and other source urls for any keyword overlap.
    * Examples
        * [ ] E-commerce
        * [ ] Payments
        * [ ] Subscriptions
        * [ ] Team leadership responsibilities.
        * [ ] Project ownership for 30-50 projects over 8 years.
        * [ ] Understanding how projects are structured for consultancies.

#### Flags

* [ ] Capture `Green` and other minor `Red Flags`.
    * [ ] Minor red flags help us make decisions through the offer process.
    * [ ] Green flags or highlights can somewhat be interchangeable as "what excites me about working here."
    * [ ] Useful to capture flags uncovered during the interview process.
    * [ ] Flags flesh out whether I want to work here 2 years or 8.
    * [ ] Record timestamp as `Green/Red flags completed: ` in [Overview](../index.md)
    * [ ] Copy timestamp to `opportunities--{date}` file.

### Optional

The following sections are not necessary for completion. Questions or highlights can often come during the interview preparation process.

#### Highlights

* [ ] Capture `Highlights` as positive points of interest.
    * [ ] Is it a consultancy or product?
    * [ ] What is unique about the company or role?

#### Questions

* [ ] Capture `Questions` as points of interest to bring up with the recruiter, hiring manager, and/or team.
    * [ ] One of the common questions to ask is generally sufficient for most companies.
    * [ ] There may be some unique feature I would love to be explained or some misunderstanding in the job description.

## Tailor Resume

* [ ] Resume complete
    * Tailoring requires more of a "master resume" in my case where the 8+ years at Rethink has generated too many items to list.
    * I currently do not tailor my resume. I take the abundant highlights or technology keywords and use them in the cover letter. I've had a low rejection % but it may be ideal to strive for near zero.
    * [ ] Matches keywords in the job description up to x%.
    * [ ] Use the rule of 3 to whittle down highlights of the last employer.
    * [ ] Whittle down technology keywords, use your judgment.
    * [ ] Summary currently isn't printed in favor of the cover letter. Should we reverse this decision? Permanently?
    * [ ] Generate PDF
    * [ ] Copy PDF to the [Files](../files/index.md) section.
    * [ ] Record timestamp as `Resume completed: ` in [Overview](../index.md)
    * [ ] Copy timestamp to `opportunities--{date}` file.

## Generate Cover Letter

* [ ] Cover letter generated
    * Should read like one of adoration. What do I think I expect or what will I bring to this relationship?
    * [ ] Duplicate cover letter template as `{year}-{technology}-{company}` to match the prospect parent directory.
    * [ ] Header includes **all contact information**, my resume purposefully leaves this out.
    * [ ] Include 1 to 3 highlights that excite me about the role. "To learn Elixir" should only be a partial answer.
        * [ ] Source from the `Green Flags` or `Highlights` sections.
        * [ ] 1 - 2 highlights in the opening paragraph, it needs to hook the reader.
        * [ ] Last highlight in the closing paragraph, to reiterate my capabilities.
    * [ ] Rule of 3 list items section including metrics and keyword overlap
    * [ ] Run letter through Grammarly, correcting mistakes.
    * [ ] Read letter aloud to verify tense is kept throughout and new information flows.
    * [ ] Generate cover letter using Obsidian's `Export to PDF` command from the command palette.
    * [ ] Copy PDF to the [Files](../files/index.md) section.
    * [ ] Record timestamp as `Cover letter generated: ` in [Overview](../index.md)
    * [ ] Copy timestamp to `opportunities--{date}` file.

## Submit Application

* [ ] Application submitted
    * [ ] Make changes to the [Application Fields](index.md#application-fields) section and verify completion.
    * [ ] Paste contents of each field into their place.
    * [ ] Attach cover letter or paste text from PDF.
    * [ ] Attach resume.
    * [ ] Check all values match at least twice.
    * [ ] Click Submit when complete.
    * [ ] Record timestamp as `Application sent: ` in [Overview](../index.md)
    * [ ] Copy timestamp to `opportunities--{date}` file.

## Waiting for the Interview

* [ ] Check email for automated response
    * [ ] Record timestamp as `Response (automated): ` in [Overview](../index.md)
    * [ ] Timestamps are no longer copied to the opportunities "batch" file.
* [ ] Move to the [Interview Checklist](../interviews/checklist.md) to as correspondence is received.
    * This is a bit of a purgatory until interviews are scheduled and completed.
    * It is useful to capture hiccups in correspondence or scheduling. This may or may not be a red flag.
