### Flags

#### Checklist for Flag Discovery

These red or green flags should be sourced **very early in the discovery process** as things like a drug screen completely disqualify the position. There should be at least one green flag for every company though as this often points to what excites me.

* Employment type
  * Look for evidence of US-based W2 work.
  * Remote.com seemed suspect given the tabs to GitLab and their notorious "pay you shitty for where you live" mantra.
* Drug Tests
  * Joydrive is based in Washington State where weed is legal and yet requires a passing drug screening?
  * I don't want to feel like a criminal when take CBD to curb rare anxiety spikes.
  * I've stressed about these in the past and I'd rather not be subject to that ever again. The interview process is stressful enough.
* Elixir without Phoenix
  * Not the biggest red flag but this should be highlighted as mention of other languages like Go or Python could mean that Elixir isn't the star focus.
* Seem to require Elixir experience
  * Companies that aren't willing to train should be a red flag. They can still be a good place to work but know the battle here may be rougher than other places.
* Onsite
  * BinaryNoggin was **difficult as hell to pin down** as a remote-friendly place to work. There was all sorts of mixed messaging.
* Web3 / Blockchain
  * Not necessarily a red flag but this is not a preference.

## Questions

### Motivation Questions

Questions expected during the interview process. I should be able to tell every employer why I want to work there for instance.

* Why do you want to work here?
  * "To learn Elixir and Phoenix Framework!" is not a sufficient enough answer.
  * Swerdlin: Initially I just needed a job but writing Windows applications was a huge draw at the time. I brought in advanced concepts like automated builds and testing.
  * Intouch: I wanted to make kiosk applications as the process sounded extremely cool. The execution wasn't perfect but we had very functional processes in 99% of our projects.
  * Rethink: I wanted to work for a Christian organization supplying curriculum. I also really wanted to work with Tyler again. I revitalized the company single-handedly though other people like Jamie or Ben deserve some credit. Tyler had a huge hand in Jira / Confluence.
* Why are you passionate about the company?
* What excites you about this job?
* What are you looking for?
  * How does working at this company specifically help me reach my goals?
* Optional: How familiar are you with our company or product?

### Interview Questions

Unique questions to bring up during future interviews.

* TODO

## Highlights

This can be links to sources for the motivational questions above like what excites me about a position or why I want to work here.

* TODO

## Cover Letter

What in my work history should be called out as a match with this opportunity? The cover letter might as well be a love letter. How can I show the employer I'll be a strong candidate for this role specifically in addition to the company overall? 

* TODO

## Job Description Checklist

Capture the complete job description converted from basic HTML to Markdown. This helps us discern changes over time. Convert the bullet points to checkmarks to determine if I'm a good fit. I should score a 60% or higher for most companies, may be willing to apply to 40-50% for the experience.

* TODO

## Application Fields

Capture the application fields to help with copy/paste later. We want to capture the data to be thorough for historical purposes.
