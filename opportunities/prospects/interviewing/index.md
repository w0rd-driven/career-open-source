# Interviewing

Interview is either scheduled or actively occurring.
The next stage is one of the following:

* Offer
    * Offers move out of the `prospects` directory and up to the dedicated `offers` parent directory.
* Retry
    * Try again at a later date. This is generally rare and only applicable if I halt the process though it's technically a rejection.
* Rejected
    * One or both parties halted the interview process.
