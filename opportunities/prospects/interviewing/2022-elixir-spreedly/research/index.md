## Job description checklist

(Senior Software Engineer, Multiple Roles)

Spreedly is the world’s first, and leading, Payments Orchestration solution. Our vision is that the world is better with a diversified, inclusive payment ecosystem. Our mission is to accelerate commerce with an open, secure, and flexible payment platform that welcomes all payment participants. Backed by Spectrum Equity, with a $75M investment, Spreedly is experiencing rapid growth.

Connecting to multiple payment services, known as payment orchestration, is the new standard. With Spreedly’s PCI-compliant cloud solution, merchants can connect to multiple payment services simultaneously, optimize their payment stack, control card data, and accept alternative payment types.

Our employees help us execute against our vision through building a culture focused on autonomy, transparency, and collaboration in a dynamic, high-growth organization.

Our list of "amazing functionality that customers will happily pay us for if we can just get it implemented..." is growing faster than we can check things off, and we need help from an experienced engineer that can hop into a high-functioning, experienced team and start learning and contributing quickly.

When you start at Spreedly (think first 6-12 months), you'll be spending 90%+ of your time working right on the product team building functionality for customers. Building product at Spreedly is a bit unique in that our main product is a payments API used by other developers. So while "designing a UI" may mean exactly what it sounds like (creating administrative and analytics tools), it often means thinking through how YOU would want a given API to work if you were using it. "Adding a feature for a customer" often means working through how to securely enable a developer to do something interesting with a credit card number. Super challenging and fun, we think! And since we work with credit card data on a daily basis, thinking about security is a way of life at Spreedly, as is building sustainable processes to keep that information safe (and our auditors happy).

What we're looking for in a senior engineer is somebody who's excited by jumping into pretty complex technical problems and making sense of them. We regularly deal with encryption, encoding, and security, all within the context of a distributed system. You don't have to be an expert in any of those aspects, but you should be really open to learning about them. Once you've gotten your feet under you and understand the domain well enough, we'd like you to mentor junior engineers and help them tackle the task at hand using pragmatic software practices. We're looking for people who are good at their job who are also interested in elevating the people around them.

### What We're Looking For

* [x] A track record of delivering well-crafted software
* [x] A willingness to be a generalist and the curiosity to try new things you've never done before
* [x] Excitement about building products for Spreedly's customers, who are primarily businesses doing commerce and their developers who are using our API's and toolkits
* [x] Excellent written communication skills, and a willingness to use them to document your work as necessary
* [x] The ability to operate autonomously, sorting your own immediate priorities out of the ever-shifting needs of a startup environment
* [x] Confidence in your ability to learn new tech as necessary. Today we work primarily with Ruby, Rails, Elixir, Phoenix, Riak, Kafka, Postgres, Redis, and Linux ... but are always pragmatically evaluating new languages and tools

### What We Offer

* Competitive salary + Equity
* Outstanding Medical and Dental Insurance: Premiums are 100% company paid for employees and families
* Note: We offer two PPO health insurance plans: A traditional copay and a high deductible with HSA. Spreedly contributes $1,200/$2,400 per year to the HSA for those choosing the high deductible plan
* Life and long-term disability insurance
* Optional Vision insurance and various Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)
* Open Paid Time Off policy + 12 weeks paid leave for new parents
* Matching 401k plan (5% up to $5,000 yearly)
* Monthly digital lifestyle stipend ($150), new Macbook, and $200 accessory reimbursement
* $3,000 annual Professional Development stipend and free LinkedIn Learning subscription
* Flexible, remote friendly work environment
* Quarterly visits to HQ for remote employees

We're constantly striving to have the fairest and most productive hiring process possible. We want to ensure that every candidate is treated equally and our interactions are designed with that goal in mind. If you want to get a sense for what your application process will look like, we'd encourage you to read the following: [Stop Hazing Your Potential Hires](http://engineering.spreedly.com/blog/stop-hazing-your-potential-hires.html) and [Programming Puzzles Are Not the Answer | by Ryan Daigle | Spreedly Engineering | Medium](https://medium.com/spreedly-engineering/programming-puzzles-are-not-the-answer-c76575d13e66).

If this at all sounds interesting, we'd love to hear from you!

Spreedly is an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. We actively work to drive out even unintentional discrimination in our hiring processes via practices like blindly graded work samples, structured interviews, and diversity awareness training.

Due to the sensitive nature of what Spreedly does- handling payment data- candidates must complete a successful background check. If you have concerns along those lines, please discuss with us sooner rather than later- we do not want you to waste time in the hiring process and get disqualified at the end if we can help it.

Spreedly has implemented a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy for all in office and in-person company meetings, including mandatory quarterly all hands event.

Some of our positions are open to remote applicants. If this is the case it will be sited in the job posting just below the position name. Unless otherwise stated, remote positions are open to candidates in the contiguous US only. We are not set up to support remote employees from CA, NY, or outside the contiguous US. All applicants must have a US work visa.  

We appreciate your interest in our company. Because of the high volume of resume flow, we may only respond to those candidates that we think will be a potential fit.
