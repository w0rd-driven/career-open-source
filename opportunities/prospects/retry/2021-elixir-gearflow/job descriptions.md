## Construction's First Parts Marketplace

In an industry where costs have doubled and margins are tight, there can be no lapse in productivity. With equipment downtime being a contractors largest cost, there is an enormous amount of productivity wasted due to the pains that come with parts procurement.

At [Gearflow](https://gearflow.com), we are on a mission to address construction's productivity problem, one that we have experienced first hand, by streamlining equipment parts procurement and eliminating the fleet maintenance pains that come with it.

- A marketplace where vetted part suppliers can easily become an e-commerce enabled business and build their business's brand online.
- A marketplace where equipment owners can find the parts they need from suppliers they can trust so they can get back to work.

### Who Are We?

We are an eclectic, diverse group of thinkers that are all energized by this massive problem we are tackling for construction's underserved majority.

On the surface, we are all very different. And that is what makes our days so fun.

> *"I watch it in action every day, Surrounded by high performers and out of the box thinkers. Your character, skill and drive will determine your success within Gearflow. You'll see opportunities instead of obstacles, and have a team to support and grow alongside with you. I couldn't even imagine working anywhere else."
-*Sarah, Director of BD

### Who You Might Be

We are recruiting highly talented people who get excited about bringing digital solutions to analog processes.

People who are inspired by serving generational business in the construction industry, and get energized by innovating in an “un-sexy” industry.

We want to add people who have a passion for creating life-changing value for people doing real work.

### Why Now Is The Time To Join Gearflow

We just raised our [$3M seed round](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickdaso/2021/07/07/gearflow-raises-3-million-to-build-the-go-to-construction-marketplace/?sh=357fb5ee323c) in June '21 to invest in growing our engineering team. We have a lot of demand for what we are building and working to go faster in catching up.

The market timing is right for Gearflow.

The pandemic has accelerated the need for ecommerce while parts is the largest contributor to a construction equipment manufacturer's profitability. Suppliers are actively seeking a marketplace built for them to adapt to the fast changing buyer needs and to protect their parts business from players like Amazon.

The timing could not be better to finally address construction's largest productivity problem.

### Where are you located?

We have an office in downtown Chicago for those who prefer to come into an office. We currently have employees in Boston, Chicago, and Detroit.

We have quarterly onsite meetings in our office in Chicago so you must be willing to travel at least quarterly.

### Have you fundraised?

Yes. We raised an [angel round of $1.6M](https://www.newswire.com/news/gearflow-com-raises-1-1m-seed-funding-to-elevate-construction-21013655) at the end of 2019 and just [closed a $3M seed round of funding](https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/inno/stories/fundings/2021/06/24/construction-equipment-startup-raises-3m.html) in June 2021.

### What kind of suppliers are on Gearflow?

We primarily work with equipment part suppliers in the aerial, dirt, and material handling equipment categories.

### Weren't you targeting equipment rental?

Yes. We were initially targeting equipment rental, equipment sales, parts, and everything in between. 

However, after hundreds of calls from customers who were in need of parts to get their down piece of equipment back up and running we realized that we needed to focus everything on this parts problem. We found that across the board, there was an enormous amount of pain, productivity loss, and waste stemming from parts procurement so this is what we set out to solve.

### Who are your customers?

We serve equipment owners and fleet managers across all kinds of businesses from airplane maintenance facilities to MLB ballparks to everyone in between.

However, our most common customers with the most urgent need are the small to mid sized construction contractors that make up the majority of the industry.

### What is the long term vision of Gearflow?

We are with customers from the moment their equipment breaks down to the moment they get that equipment back up and running. 

Therefore, we are not in the parts business. Instead, we are in the productivity business and the pains stemming from today's parts procurement process is at the center of construction's productivity problem. 

We're not here to "disrupt" the parts supply chain. Instead, we're here to build a tech layer on top of it to add much needed productivity and personalization to both sides of the marketplace.

### What is your tech stack?

Our stack is Elixir/Phoenix, with a front end powered by LiveView, Tailwind and Alpine. [[Read more about this combination here](https://changelog.com/posts/petal-the-end-to-end-web-stack).] Our data sources are Postgres and Elasticsearch. Our stack was freshly re-written (early 2020) so there’s a lot of room to grow and expand.

### Do you need experience in Elixir?

It depends on the role but for the most part, no you do not. 

> *“The amount of professional growth I’ve experienced at Gearflow is unmatched, and the opportunities to keep growing and learning are abundant. It’s a great feeling to contribute so much to a small team that’s making a real impact in an industry that is hungry for change.”
