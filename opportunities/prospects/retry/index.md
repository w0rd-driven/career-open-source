# Retry

Try again later. Either the job post expired, one or both parties were ghosted or rejected.
**Note: This is generally the only instance where I currently reuse the generated files. I purposefully generate new data to keep the full history.**
The next stage is one of the following:

* Research
    * If applied before or the post expired, it is typically useful to go through at least a portion of the research phase again. The company may not have changed much but the expectations for the post might.
* Applied
    * Application (to be) sent. This typically happens if the research was complete and the post was identical.
