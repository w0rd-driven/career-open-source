# Job Offers

This is a section for storing past or future job offers. It would also be useful to repurpose the `Choosing Between Offers` spreadsheet from the MIT Career Development Handbook through each "batch". It's important to document the approach, any pros or cons, and the ultimate decision. This will help guide future decisions and it's always possible things will change over time.
