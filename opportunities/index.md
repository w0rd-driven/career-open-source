Job offers received over the entirety of my career, both signed and rejected.

## Past

[Past](past/index.md)

Current and previous employment. The section is meant to store green or red flags, periodic vibe checks, and other similar information we gather for prospective employers. It's important to document how jobs change over time.

## Prospects

[Prospects](prospects/index.md)

Prospective job opportunities from the past and future. These follow the workflow outlined in [our action plan](/action%20plan/opportunities--2021/index.md).
