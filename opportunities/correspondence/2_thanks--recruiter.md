# Thank You Recruiter

## Stage 2: Recruiter Interview

Typically sent to my first contact and depending on rapport, can be either formal or informal. I want to show excitement, getting chosen from a list of candidates is a big deal. I want to stand out by showing that I was listening and really enjoyed the chat.

Response should be by the end of day and differs from moving onto the next round.

## Thank You
