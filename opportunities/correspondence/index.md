To save some time, I should at least have some rough talking points on how to respond during every phase of the process. The text is largely broken up between formal and informal with rough steps laid out. Talking to hiring managers or the team sometimes flips around but initial contact is almost always with a recruiter type.

Correspondence can sometimes happen multiple times and no amount of forethought can really predict every communication. Getting started is usually the hardest part though.
