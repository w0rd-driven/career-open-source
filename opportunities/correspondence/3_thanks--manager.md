# Thank You Manager

## Stage 3: Manager Interview

Should be slightly different from a recruiter thank you as it should be a deeper discussion about the team. I also want to show excitement here as moving through the process also isn't a guarantee. I want to stand out by showing that I was also listening here and really enjoyed the chat.

Response should be by the end of day and differs from moving onto the next round.

## Thank You
