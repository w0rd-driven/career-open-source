# Response Offer

## Stage 4: Team Interview

This is typically the response to passing all of the interview steps. There may or may not be another interview step with C-level types as more of a final interview after the team decision. This may or may not include a background and reference check. **This is not accepting or rejecting the offer, it is merely letting them know it has been received and when to expect a response**. The response may have a time limit imposed on their end which is only a red flag if it's within days.

Response should be within 24 to 48 hours.
