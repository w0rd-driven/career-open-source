## Async Work

[https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1523649517354201088](https://twitter.com/SergioRocks/status/1523649517354201088)

1. Avoid recurring meetings

    For recurring processes (eg: weekly standup) make them async by default. Meetings are only booked in case there are blockers or other dependencies that require live discussion.
    A meeting should be used as the exception, not the rule. If you have recurring meetings in your team, add this to the agenda in the next occurrence:

    * "How can we stop having this recurring meeting?"

    You'll get weird looks at first, but then everyone will love it.

2. Don't jump on meetings to share information

    If the meeting flow would be unidirectional (as in, one party talking and the other listening). Make it a piece of documentation instead. @NotionHQ and @loom are great tools for this.
    Some examples:

    * You're collecting feedback on a new feature - Record a Loom and describe feedback you need in Notion
    * You're making a demo - Record a Loom and share it
    * You're asking for daily/weekly standup - Create a Notion page where everyone adds their written updates

3. Always start a meeting with agenda & goals

    If you decided you need to have a meeting for a certain work flow (which sometimes you do need). Make sure everyone contributes with:

    * Clear agenda items
    * Clear goals

4. Always end the meeting with action items & assignees

    Make sure you reserve the last 5-10 minutes of any meeting to collaboratively create documentation on:

    * Action items to be done as a meeting follow up
    * Clear assignees to own each of them
    * Deadlines, if relevant

    Points 3️⃣ and 4️⃣ actually avoid meetings. Having efficient meetings avoids the proverbial "Let's book a follow up meeting to continue this conversation".
    People naturally love to talk. It's a trap! You can escape it by following efficient processes.

5. Have a "pre-meeting triage" template

    For external meetings, push the other party to write the agenda and goals. You'll find that:

    * You can fulfill the goals by writing
    * Or you're not even interested
    * Or the written pre-work makes the meeting more efficient, if you have it

    This is my "pre-meeting triage" template:

    ```text
    Hi, thanks for reaching out.

    I'm actively trying to avoid meetings. Don't take it personally, but I work async and meetings kill my flow.

    Please:

    1. Tell me what's your goal for our would-be meeting.
    2. Share any relevant materials you'd preset during the meeting, I'll review them async.

    I commit to review your reply, and get back to you in case I'm interested in engaging further. I promise our meeting will be much more productive after this prep work :)
    ```

6. Plan ahead to avoid rush meetings to handle exceptions

    When there's lack of planning, everything is an exception. Exceptions aren't treated with "business as usual" process, they are fast tracked as an urgent matter.
    When everything is urgent, nothing gets done. Meetings are the natural fall back to handling urgent matters.
    These meetings are the worse for everyone, since they don't usually have an agenda. People just breath heavily together trying to identify the problem and solve it ASAP.
    Reduce exceptions by planning ahead.

7. Book calendar slots for Deep Work

    Set your calendar settings to automatically decline any meeting that overlaps.
    Also set you status on @SlackHQ to "Do not disturb" to allow yourself to time to tackle tasks that require a deep level of focus for an extended period of time.
    If you're a leader, create a safe psychological space for your team members to book and respect each others' Deep Work slots.
    Unavailability is unpopular by default, you need to proactively make it popular.
    The positive results will compound in delivery quality and peer trust.

Summary:

1️⃣ Avoid recurring meetings
2️⃣ Don't use meetings to share information
3️⃣ Start a meeting with agenda & goals
4️⃣ End the meeting with action items & assignees
5️⃣ Have a "pre-meeting triage" template
6️⃣ Plan ahead to avoid exceptions
7️⃣ Book calendar slots for Deep Work
