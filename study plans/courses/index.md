# Course Study Plans

This directory lists individual study plan files by course title across the various platforms. This also includes things like self paced guidance through the Advent of Code, Elixir Koans, Exercism, or Udemy and other course sites. The intention is to list them and try to work through them eventually before the content becomes too stale. I've yet to do this other than working through koans or exercism so I have no good complete guides here either.
