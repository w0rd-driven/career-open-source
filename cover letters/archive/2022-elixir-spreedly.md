Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm ecstatic to see the job listing for the Senior Software Engineer position at Spreedly. As a Full Stack Web Developer with over 11 years of professional experience, I would be a great addition to your team. My expertise spans the bulk of the software needs of small to medium businesses. I've made multiple career transitions as I started with systems administration, moved to desktop and web development in C#, then again to focus on web development with Laravel in PHP.

I favor the challenge of working on mission-critical tasks like integrating payment systems or including metadata for the accounting department to track subscriptions within Stripe. I'm intimately familiar with complex data synchronization between bespoke systems or SaaS integrations like HubSpot. I continuously desire to have a fundamental understanding of the systems architecture running web projects I've deployed, either through virtual machines on Digital Ocean or Docker containers utilized via Gitlab CI.

At my most recent job, I was partially instrumental in

* Implementing product payments, accounting for millions in annualized transaction volume.
* Leveraging Stripe for digital and physical subscriptions accounting for thousands in monthly recurring revenue.
* Rearchitecting the materials site as a SPA to reduce a time-consuming query to parallel API calls that aggregate the data in the browser, shaving page load times from an average of 5 seconds to 300 milliseconds.
* Reviewing external team merge requests to ensure code quality and integrity as a subject matter expert over many internal systems.
* Introducing Gitlab CI to automate tests and deployments for projects.

With my proven track record and range of contributions, I am confident I would be able to make a lasting impact on the future of the company.

I'm eager to dive deep into understanding Elixir and the Phoenix Framework with guidance from the team at Spreedly.

Thank you for your time and the opportunity,

Sincerely,
Jeremy Brayton
